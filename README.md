# eCommerce Website Project

This is an eCommerce work-in-progress project by my partner Brady Zhang (bwz3kt@virginia.edu and bwz3kt on GitHub) and I. Currently, it is an eCommerce website that integrates SQL with HTML and PHP. It is intended to be run with Apache and MySQL via XAMPP. The "purpose" of the site is to establish an online market with a unique product.

The functionalities of the site, currently, are:
* Back-end server that stores user data
* Working login system with required field formats (for example, email address check using regex)
* Payment using BitCoin
  * Live updating Bitcoin price relative to USD
* Shopping Cart with delete/add functionalities
* Contact Us form using PHPMailer, which is sent to a provided webmaster email
* Differing pages and purchasing functionality restricted to validated/logged in users
